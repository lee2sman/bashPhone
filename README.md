bashPhone
=========

This is an ascii art implementation of iphone-like "apps" for Bash. In other words, this program is meant to emulate a smartphone with apps. The apps are all bash scripts/aliases. Future plans include wrapping this in Curses as well as creating ability to add or remove "apps" or create your own. Who knows, maybe this could be a thing?!

Note: Current version 0.1 is a proof of concept rather than fully realized program.

=====
v0.1 Text file ascii drawing called with an alias 'bashphone'. Individual apps are other aliases.

v0.5 Bash script that prints smartphone ascii pic to terminal

v1 implement Curses wrapper

v2 ability to install and deinstall "apps" scripts
