bashPhone
=========

This is an ascii art implementation of iphone-like "apps" for Bash. In other words, this program is meant to emulate a smartphone with apps. The apps are all bash scripts/aliases. Future plans include wrapping this in Curses as well as creating ability to add or remove "apps" or create your own. Who knows, maybe this could be a thing?!

Note: Current version 0.1 is a proof of concept rather than fully realized program.

How to use currently
===================
**1.**  Edit your bash profile

    cd
    nano .bash_profile

**2.**  You need to edit the file for your own needs and computer. Full tutorial to be forthcoming.
Change the path for the bashphone alias to where iphoneWithApps.txt is located on your computer.
Do the same with other aliases.

**3.**  Create your own "apps" by writing your own aliases. At some point I'll post these programs too. Would be nice to turn these into installable "apps."
